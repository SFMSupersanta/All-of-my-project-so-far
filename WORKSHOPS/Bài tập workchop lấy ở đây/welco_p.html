               BTP100 covers the fundamentals of
               computer programming.&nbsp; A comprehensive subset of the
               C language is used as the programming language throughout
               this subject.&nbsp; Upon successful completion, you will be able
               to write command-line solutions to an unlimited number of small,
               but nevertheless, real-world problems.
               </p>
               <p>
               The subject web site contains all of the material that
               you need to master.&nbsp; The complete URL of its home page
               is

               </ul>
               The home page contains general information as well as day-to-day reminders
               and notes.&nbsp;  Bookmark this page and check it regularly.
               </p>
               <p>
               This web site was originally developed from a now superceded edition of the
               supporting subject notes.&nbsp; You can obtain the most recent
               edition of these notes at the Seneca@York Bookstore
               <ul>
               <li>Weaver, Evan (2003). "Foundations of Programming Using C".  Seneca College.
               </li>
               </ul>
               The web site and the subject notes present just enough syntax
               to cover the fundamentals of programming, yet not so much as to
               distract you with advanced or obscure topics.&nbsp; If you use the
               web site and the subject notes as your primary resources, you
               should have enough time to read all of the material
               without skipping parts and to practice solving a fair number of
               problems throughout the semester.&nbsp;
               </p>
               <p>
               You may find this subject quite demanding, especially if you have no
               programming experience.&nbsp; But, you should be able to master
               all of the material if you participate fully in the:
               <ul>
               <li>Lectures and Class Discussions: where we discuss the material
               in the readings.</li>
               <li>Workshops: where we solve small problems that implement concepts
               introduced in the readings.</li>
               <li>Assignments: where you work on projects that integrate the topics covered
               in the readings.</li>
               <li>Presentation: where you present the work of your team on a
               problem of your choosing.</li>
               </ul>
               Keeping up with the readings, the workshops and the assignments is crucial
               to success in this subject.&nbsp; Catching up may require substantial
               if not massive effort.&nbsp; Those students who have done poorly
               have often attributed their performance to having fallen behind
               early in the semester.&nbsp; Heed their experience and keep up with
               the schedule from the start.&nbsp;
               </p>
               <p>
               This subject web site evolves.&nbsp; If you have any suggestions
               on how it could be improved, please feel free to let your
               instructor know.&nbsp; Many student suggestions have been incorporated
               since the initial posting.

               <p>
               To pass this subject, you must:
               <ul>
               <li>pass the final exam,</li>
               <li>pass the total of all assessments,</li>
               <li>submit all assignments in working order, and</li>
               <li>pass a weighted average of the tests and the final exam.</li>
               </ul>
               </p>
               <p>
               A pass is a mark of 60% or better.&nbsp; The total mark
               is a weighted combination.&nbsp; The weights are:
               <ul>
               <li>Workshops  9%</li>
               <li>Assignments   20%</li>
               <li>Quizzes 6%</li>
               <li>Tests   30%</li>
               <li>Presentation  5%</li>
               <li>Exam 30%</li>
               </ul>
               The workshop and presentation marks measure team
               performance (14%).&nbsp; The other marks measure individual
               performance (86%).

               Your assignments  will be graded to the
               following detail standards and rubric.
               <ul>
               <li>Submission instructions on the
               assignment specifications are followed
               <li>A copy of an unedited phobos typescript
               is submitted
               <li>There are no global variables
               <li>There are no jump statements (goto, continue or
               break except for break in switch statements)
               <li>All variable and function
               names are descriptive
               <li>Source files begin with a header comment.&nbsp;
               The comment includes
               <ul>
               <li>the assignment name and number
               <li>a brief description of the assignment
               <li>the name of the source file
               <li>your name
               <li>date last modified
               </ul>
               <li>The meaning of each variable, including its
               units, constraints and other details is clarified
               in inline comments.&nbsp; Only additional information
               is provided here: the declaration is not repeated in words
               <li>Code is indented consistently throughout to
               reveal the structure of the logic
               <li>There are no spelling errors in the comments,
               names or strings
               <li>There are no magic numbers: Name constants in
               CAPITALS.&nbsp; (For example, use #define PI 3.14159
               at the head of the code and use PI throughout
               the code.)  Use _ between words in constant
               names.
               <li>Each function has a single entry point and
               a single exit point
               <li>Functions and blocks of code within them
               are separated using blank lines
               <li>The purpose of each function and its return
               value, if any, is described
               </ul>
               You will receive a deduction of 0.5 for each
               breach of these detail standards, within the limits
               described below.</p>

               The subject material appears on separate pages
               called readings.&nbsp; Each reading has the
               same format as shown in Figure 5 below.&nbsp; The learning
               outcome appears directly below the title.&nbsp;
               An appropriate quote may appear below the outcome.&nbsp;
               Below these is a list of the sections in the reading.&nbsp;
               Select a section to move directly to that part of the reading.&nbsp;
               The exercise section lists, the
               related workshop problem, if any,
               the related pages in the
               supporting subject notes and suggested exercises.&nbsp; If you need
               another view of the material try one of the links on
               the <a href="tutorials.html" tppabs="http://cs.senecac.on.ca/~btp100/pages/resources/tutorials.html">tutorials</a> page off the resources page.&nbsp;

               A Reading<br />
               Figure 5
               <br />
               </p>
               The readings are organized into nine (9)
               distinct modules:
               <ul>
               <li>introduction</li>
               <li>computation</li>
               <li>logic</li>
               <li>functions</li>
               <li>libraries</li>

               </ul>
               </p>
               <p>
               Each reading introduces one concept,
               outlines the theory associated with that concept and
               illustrates the concept using sample code.&nbsp;
               Typically, one lecture covers one reading.&nbsp;
               You might find it helpful to bring a printed
               copy of the day's reading to class and to mark
               it up during the discussions.
               </p>

               <p class="ssection">Workshops</p>
               Each workshop contains a
               selection of problems of varying difficulty.&nbsp;
               These problems apply the concepts introduced in
               the week's readings.&nbsp; Join a team and select
               a problem that is different from those most chosen by
               other teams.&nbsp; Submit your team's solution
               to the workshop before the end of the weekend.
               </p>

               <p id="exp" class="section">Expectations</p>
               <p>
               You may:
               <ul>
               <li>ask any questions you have regarding
               your own progress in the subject,
               <li>have your opinion heard if you disagree with
               the view of a student or your instructor, and
               <li>correct the mistakes of your instructor
               </ul>
               You may expect to:
               <ul>
               <li>have access to up-to-date web pages on
               the evening of the day before a scheduled lecture
               or workshop</li>
               <li>receive email replies from your instructor
               within 24 hours except on weekends</li>
               <li>have your marks posted no later than
               two weeks after the submission date</li>
               <li>be treated fairly in regard to any penalties</li>
               <li>receive special consideration if you cannot write a
               scheduled test or submit an assignment on time because of
               a medical or extraordinary situation</li>
               <li>receive additional help if you encounter difficulty</li>
               <li>receive feedback regarding your assignment submissions within one week</li>
               </ul>
               If your instructor has not notified you about your submission
               within a week, feel free to ask about it.&nbsp;
               There are times when something happens in
               the transmission and your instructor may need you to resubmit
               your work.
               </p>
               <p>
               If, in the view of your instructor, you
               are having a problem, your instructor will ask you to arrange
               a private meeting.&nbsp; Problems may involve marginal attendance,
               missing assignments, or lack of communication with others.&nbsp; The
               instructor will try to help you determine why you are having
               difficulty and how you can improve your standing.

               The Academic Policy of Seneca College
               applies to the School of Computer Studies.&nbsp;
               Cheating, plagiarism and breach of copyright
               are serious offenses under this Policy.&nbsp; The official version of the
               Cheating and Plagiarism Section is <a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.senecac.on.ca/home/academic_policy/cheat.html  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.senecac.on.ca/home/academic_policy/cheat.html'" tppabs="http://www.senecac.on.ca/home/academic_policy/cheat.html">here</a>.
               </p>

               <p class="ssection">Cheating</p>
               <p>
               Cheating during a test or exam is construed as
               talking, peeking at another student’s
               paper or any other clandestine method of
               transmitting information.
               </p>

               <p class=ssection>Plagiarism</p>
               <p>
               Plagiarism is using the work of others without
               citing it; that is, holding the work of others out as
               your own work.
               </p>
               <p>
               Do not submit an assignment that contains
               material copied from another student, a
               website, a textbook or any other published
               source without identifying the material
               that is not your own.&nbsp;
               Simple rewording of someone else's submission
               or changing the field names in their program
               and presenting their work as your own may be
               construed as plagiarism: you are still copying
               the solution and submitting it as your own.&nbsp;
               Plagiarism is not excusable by trivial differences
               in the code or the wording.
               </p>
               <p>
               Assignments
               are individual work.&nbsp; If your instructor
               notices that you have copied parts of your
               submission from another student or external
               source without citation, your instructor
               may charge you with plagiarism.&nbsp;
               </p>
               <p>
               Studying and improving others’ code is
               a good way to learn.&nbsp; You may imitate and
               dissect the sample code in the subject web
               site and the printed subject notes.&nbsp; You
               may use this code in your submissions,
               including your assignments.&nbsp;
               You do not need to cite the authors of
               the code that you have copied
               from the printed subject notes or this web site.&nbsp;
               You may copy the workshop code of your peers provided
               that you cite them as the authors.&nbsp; All other
               code should be entirely your own.
               </p>

               <p class=sssection>How Not To Plagiarize</p>
               <p>
               To avoid plagiarizing:
               <ul>
               <li>If you are the helper, set aside
               your notes, printouts and similar materials.&nbsp;
               Study your colleague's screen or printout and
               work with them on their problem using their
               approach.&nbsp; Help them debug their code.&nbsp;
               Do not show them how you did it.&nbsp;
               <li>If you are the person being helped,
               your objective is to understand the problem.&nbsp;
               Don’t just ask for the answer or look
               at your colleague's solution.&nbsp;
               Remember, you will need a good level of
               understanding to do well on the exam.
               </ul>
               </p>

               <p class=ssection>Breach of Copyright</p>
               <p>
