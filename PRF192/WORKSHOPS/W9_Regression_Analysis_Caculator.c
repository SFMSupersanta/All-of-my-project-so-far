////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Design and code a program that prompts for and accepts the 
name of a data file and then reads data value pairs from the 
file, while performing a linear regression analysis on the set 
of data value pairs. 

The data file contains two values per record, with the two 
fields delimited by whitespace and each record delimited by a 
newline.

Linear regression analysis models the statistical relationship 
between two sets of data values.  Typically, we use the method 
of least squares to determine the line that best fits the scatter 
of data points on an x-y graph.  The formulas for the line are:

slope (t)
 t = [ (x1 - mx)(y1 - my) + (x2 - mx)(y2 - my) +
      ... + (xn - mx)(yn - my)] /
    [ (x1 - mx)2 + (x2 - mx)2 + ... + (xn - mx)2]
               
y-intercept (b)
 b = my - t mx
where m denotes the mean, which is given by
 mx = ( x1 + x2 + x3 + ... + xn ) / n
 my = ( y1 + y2 + y3 + ... + yn ) / n
               
The statistical measure that indicates how well our best fit 
line models the relationship between the variables is called t
he correlation coefficient (Pearson or Product-Moment Correlation 
Coefficient) and is given by the formula:
 r = { [ (x1y1) + (x2y2) + ... + (xnyn) ] / n - mx my} / [ dx dy ]
where d denotes the standard deviation, which is given by
 (dx)2 = ( sx / n ) - mx2
 (dy)2 = ( sy / n ) - my2
               
where s denotes the sum of the squares, which is given by
 sx = x12 + x22 + x32 + ... + xn2
 sy = y12 + y22 + y32 + ... + yn2
               
Your program output might look something like:
