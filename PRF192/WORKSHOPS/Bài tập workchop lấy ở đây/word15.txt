        15. Suppose a file, named "comedy.dat" looks something like:

                Seinfeld 50 75
                Carson 40 20
                Leno 45 50
                Letterman 20 95

            where each line of the file has a comedian's last name,  his
            or her F.I. (funny index, higher means funnier) and  his  or
            her N.I. (nastiness index,  higher  means  nastier).  Spaces
            separate each field in a record of this file.

            Write a program  that  reads  through  this  file  and  then
            displays the minimum, maximum and average values for each of
            the F.I. and the N.I.
