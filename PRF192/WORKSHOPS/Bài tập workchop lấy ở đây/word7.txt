        7.  Write a C program that asks  the  user  whether  to  convert
            Litres or Gallons. If the user answers L (or l), the program
            asks the user to  enter  the  number  of  Litres,  and  then
            displays that in Gallons. If the user answers G (or  g)  the
            program asks the user to enter the number  of  Gallons,  and
            then displays that in Litres. Any other response by the user
            causes the program to produce  an  error  message  and  then
            stop. Assume that 1 Gallon is 3.76 Litres.
