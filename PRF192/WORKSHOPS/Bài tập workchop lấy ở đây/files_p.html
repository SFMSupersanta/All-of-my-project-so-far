					A file is a named area of secondary storage.&nbsp;
					Secondary storage is permanent.&nbsp;
					Unlike the contents of primary memory, which is volatile,
					the contents of a file is accessible after we have turned
					the power off and back on at a later time.&nbsp;
					</p>
					<p>
					A file is not necessarily stored contiguously on a
					secondary storage device.&nbsp; The file may be fragmented.&nbsp;
					The operating system controls the fragmentation,
					if any.&nbsp;
					</p>
					<p align="center"><img src="files.gif" tppabs="http://cs.senecac.on.ca/~btp100/pages/images/files.gif" height="150" width="300" /></p>
					<br />

					<p id="byt" class="section">Bytes</p>
					<p>
					The fundamental unit of a file is a byte.&nbsp; We say that
					a file is a stream of bytes.&nbsp; A file concludes with a
					special mark called the end of file mark.&nbsp; This mark
					is defined as <span class=code>EOF</span>, typically with
					a value of <span class=code>-1</span>.&nbsp; Under
					the C standard, the end of file mark may be any negative
					integer value.
					</p>
					<br />

					<p id="for" class="section">Format</p>
					<p>
					We store data in a file in either of two formats:
					<ul>
					<li>binary format, or</li>
					<li>text format.</li>
					</ul>
					In binary format, the data on the file is identical to the
					data stored in primary memory.&nbsp; Each byte on the file
					is a direct image of the corresponding byte in memory.&nbsp;
					In other words, there is no translation.&nbsp;
					</p>
					<p>
					In text format, the data on the file is in a form that
					we can display and modify using a text editor.&nbsp; The
					data on the file is a translated form of the data stored
					in primary memory.&nbsp; In text format, we introduce some
					approximation.&nbsp; For instance, consider the floating-point number
					12.345678901234 stored as a <span class=code>double</span> in
					memory.&nbsp; Let us convert this value using the <span class=code>%.2lf</span>
					specifier.&nbsp; The converted value is 12.35.&nbsp; This is the
					value that we might store on the file.&nbsp; If subsequently we read 12.35
					from the file under the <span class=code>%lf</span> conversion specifier, we
					store the value in primary memory as 12.350000000000.&nbsp; The
					value stored in primary memory is clearly different from the original
					12.345678901234!&nbsp;
					In other words, although with text format we do gain the ability to edit
					text we also lose accuracy with floating point numbers.&nbsp;
					</p>
					<p>
					Aside from readability, another advantage of text format
					is portability.&nbsp;
					We can move the data from one platform to another
					as long as the characters in the file belong to a
					standard character set shared by the platforms.&nbsp; The
					standard character set (IEC/ISO 646-1083 Invariant Code Set)
					consists of
					<ul>
					<li>52 upper and lower case alphabetic characters</li>
					<li>10 digits</li>
					<li>space</li>
					<li>horizontal tab, vertical tab and form feed</li>
					<li>29 graphic characters: ! # % ^ &amp; * ( _ ) - + = ~ [ ] ' | \ ; : " { } , . &lt; &gt; / ?</li>
					</ul>
					</p>
					<br />

					<p id="acc" class="section">Access</p>
					<p>
					Typically, a file consists of records that we can access in either of two ways
					<ul>
					<li>randomly (like CD's) or</li>
					<li>sequentially (like Cassette Tapes).</li>
					</ul>
					To access records randomly, we fix their size.&nbsp;
					With the record sizes fixed, we can determine the location of the
					record that we are seeking, jump to that location and access that record directly.&nbsp;
					In other words, we can skip the intervening records without reading them.&nbsp;
					</p>
					<p>
					Under sequential access, we access the records in the order in which they were
					created.&nbsp; In this case, the records can vary in size.&nbsp; We do not need
					to know their sizes beforehand.&nbsp;
					</p>
					<p>
					In this subject, we focus on sequential text files.
					</p>
					<br />

					<p id="con" class="section">Connecting</p>
					<p>
					We connect a file to our program using
					a <span class=high>FILE</span> data structure.&nbsp; This
					data structure holds the connection information for the
					file.
					</p>
					<p align="center"><img src="fopen.gif" tppabs="http://cs.senecac.on.ca/~btp100/pages/images/fopen.gif" height="150" width="300" /></p>
					<p>
					We allocate space for the address of this data structure in a
					declaration of the form
					<pre class=defin>
 FILE *identifier;</pre>
					<span class=high>identifer</span> is the name of a
					pointer that will hold the address of the data
					structure.&nbsp;
					The type <span class=code>FILE</span> is defined in
					<span class=code>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span>.&nbsp;
					</p>
					<p>
					For example, to allocate memory for the address
					of a file data structure, we write
					<table width="45%">
					<tr>
					<td>
					<br />
					<pre>
 #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

 FILE *fp = NULL;</pre><br /></td></tr></table>
					In this example, we initialize the pointer <span class=code>fp</span>
					to <span class=code>NULL</span> as a precaution against inadvertent
					premature dereferencing.&nbsp; If, for some
					reason, our program tries to access data at <span class=code>fp</span>
					before our program has assigned an address to <span class=code>fp</span>,
					our program will fail because dereferencing a <span class=code>NULL</span>
					address is prohibited.&nbsp; <span class=code>NULL</span>
					is defined in <span class=code>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span>.
					</p>
					<br />

					<p id="ope" class="section">Opening</p>
					<p>
					The library function <span class=code>fopen</span>
					connects a specific file to a program.&nbsp; <span class=code>fopen</span>
					returns the address of the file connection data
					structure for the named file.&nbsp;
					The prototype for <span class=code>fopen</span> is
					<pre class=defin>
 FILE *fopen(char file_name[], char mode[]);</pre>
					The first parameter is a null-byte terminated string containing
					the name of the file.&nbsp; The second parameter
					is a null-byte terminated string containing the connection mode.&nbsp;
					</p>
					<p>
					The most common connection modes are
					<ul>
					<li> <span class=code>"r"</span> - read from the file,</li>
					<li> <span class=code>"w"</span> - write to the file: if the file exists,
					truncate its contents and then write; if the file
					does not exist, create a new file and then write to that file,</li>
					<li> <span class=code>"a"</span> - write to the end of the file: if the file
					exists, append to the end of the file; if the file
					does not exist, create it and then write.</li>
					</ul>
					The mode parameter is a null-byte terminated string (NOT A CHARACTER).&nbsp;
					</p>
					<p>
					The other connection modes for text files are
					<ul>
					<li> <span class=code>"r+"</span> - opens the file for reading and possibly writing,</li>
					<li> <span class=code>"w+"</span> - opens the file for writing and possibly reading; if the file exists,
					truncates its contents and then writes to the file; if the file
					does not exist, creates a new file and then writes to that file,</li>
					<li> <span class=code>"a+"</span> - opens the file for writing to the end of the file
					and possibly reading; if the file
					exists, appends to the end of the file; if the file
					does not exist, creates it and then writes to the file.</li>
					</ul>
					<span class=code>fopen</span> returns <span class=code>NULL</span>
					if the attempt to connect to the file fails.&nbsp;
					<span class=code>fopen</span> can fail for lack of permission, premature
					removal of the secondary storage medium, device full, etc.&nbsp;
					</p>
					<br />

					<p id="clo" class="section">Closing</p>
					<p>
					The library function <span class=code>fclose</span>
					disconnects a file from a program.&nbsp; <span class=code>fclose</span>
					takes as its only parameter the address of the file
					data structure.&nbsp;
					The prototype for <span class=code>fclose</span> is
					<pre class=defin>
 int fclose(FILE *);</pre>
					If the program opened the file for writing, <span class=code>fclose</span>
					writes any data remaining in the file stream's buffer
					to the file and concludes by appending an end of
					file mark immediately after the last character.&nbsp; If the
					program opened the file for
					reading, <span class=code>fclose</span> ignores any data
					left in the file stream's buffer and closes the connection.&nbsp;
					</p>
					<p>
					For example, to open a file named <span class=code>alpha.txt</span>
					for writing and then to close the file, we write
					<table width="45%">
					<tr>
					<td>
					<br />
					<pre>
 /* Opening and closing a file
 *  openCloseFile.c
 *  Mar 21 2005
 *  BTP100
 */

 #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

 int main( ) {
     FILE *fp = NULL;

     <span class=high>fp = fopen("alpha.txt","w");&nbsp;
     if (fp != NULL) {
         /* we will add statements here later */&nbsp;
         fclose(fp);
     } else
         printf("Failed to open file\n");
     </span>
     return 0;
 }</pre><br /></td></tr></table>
					<span class=code>fclose</span> returns 0 if successful, <span class=code>EOF</span>
					if unsuccessful.&nbsp; <span class=code>fclose</span> can
					fail if the secondary storage medium is
					full, an I/O error occurs or the medium has been prematurely removed.&nbsp;
					</p>
					<br />

					<p id="wri" class="section">Writing To a File</p>
					<p>
					The library function <span class=code>fprintf</span> sends data from
					primary memory to a connected file under format control.&nbsp;
					The prototype for <span class=code>fprintf</span> is
					<pre class=defin>
 int fprintf(FILE *, char [], ...);</pre>
					The first parameter receives the
					address of the file connection data structure.&nbsp; The second
					parameter is the format string containing the text to be written
					directly to the file and the conversion specifiers, if any, to be
					applied to the data values received in the parameters following
					the format string.&nbsp; Note the similarity between the <span class=code>fprintf</span>
					and the <span class=code>printf</span> library functions.
					</p>

     return 0;
 }</pre><br /></td></tr></table>
					The library function <span class=code>fputc</span> writes a single
					character to a file.&nbsp; The prototype for <span class=code>fputc</span>
					is:
					<pre class=defin>
 int fputc(int ch, FILE *fp);</pre>
					<span class=code>ch</span> is the character to be written and <span class=code>fp</span>
					is the address of the connection data structure for the destination file.&nbsp;
					<span class=code>fputc</span> returns the character written, or
					<span class=code>EOF</span> in the event of an error.
					</p>
					<p>
					The library function <span class=code>fputs</span> writes a null-byte terminated
					character to a file.&nbsp; The prototype for <span class=code>fputs</span>
					is:
					<pre class=defin>
 int fputs(char str[], FILE *fp);</pre>
					<span class=code>str</span> is the string to be written and
					<span class=code>fp</span> is the address of the connection data structure
					for the destination file.&nbsp;
					<span class=code>fputs</span> returns a non-negative value if successful,
					or <span class=code>EOF</span> in the event of an error.
					</p>
					<br />

					<p id="rea" class="section">Reading From</p>
					<p>
					The library function <span class=code>fscanf</span> reads a sequence of
					bytes from a connected file into primary memory under format control.&nbsp;
					The prototype for <span class=code>fscanf</span> is
					<pre class=defin>
 int fscanf(FILE *, char [], ...);</pre>
					The first parameter receives the
					address of the file connection data structure.&nbsp; The second
					parameter is the format string containing the
					conversion specifiers to be applied to the subsequent
					parameters while converting the byte subsets into specific
					data types.
					</p>

					The library function <span class=code>fgetc</span> extracts a

 int fgetc(FILE *fp);</pre>
					<span class=code>fp</span> is the address of the connection data structure
