               <p>
               As your third assignment this semester, you are to subdivide
               your Payroll Deductions code into functions and to upgrade
               the validation logic to accomodate any input whatsoever.&nbsp;
               </p>
               <br />

               <p class="section">Learning Outcomes</p>
               <p>
               Upon successful completion of this assignment, you
               will have demonstrated the ability to use functions
               as well as sequence, selection and iteration structures.
               </p>
               <br />

               <p class="section">Function Design</p>
               <p>
               Upgrade your program so that another programmer can modify it
               with minimal intrusion.&nbsp; Divide your code into functions
               to achieve the highest possible cohesion and the lowest possible
               coupling.&nbsp; For guidelines on designing functions see the
               <a href="modul.html" tppabs="http://cs.senecac.on.ca/~btp100/pages/content/modul.html">Modularity</a> reading.&nbsp;
               </p>
               <p>
               Your program asks the user whether or not
               to continue with another run, and if the user answers yes,
               your program continues without terminating execution.
               </p>
               <p>
               Your program includes no less than 8 functions.&nbsp;
               Marks will be allocated for quality designs.&nbsp;
               </p>
               <br />

               <p class="section">Robust Validation</p>
               <p>
               Your program accepts and validates any input whatsoever
               from the user.&nbsp;
               DO NOT assume that the user will only enter numbers, whitespace
               or possibly a decimal point, but no other characters.&nbsp;
               Your program generates an appropriate response
               for any erroneous input.&nbsp;
               Examples of unacceptable or unreasonable input include:
               <ul>
               <li>input is negative in value</li>
               <li>RRSP contribution exceeds the income</li>
               <li>Union dues exceed the income less the RRSP contribution</li>
               <li>a decimal point appears in integer input</li>
               <li>more than one decimal point appears in floating-point input</li>
               <li>characters are embedded in numeric input</li>
               </ul>
