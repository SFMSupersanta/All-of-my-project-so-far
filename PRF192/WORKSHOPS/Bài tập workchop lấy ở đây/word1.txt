        1.  Write a program that asks the user  to  enter  repeatedly  a
            number of gallons, stopping once the user enters a value  of
            0. As each value is entered,  the  corresponding  number  of
            litres is displayed. Assume that 1 gallon  is  3.76  litres.
            The following shows a sample run of the program:

                How many gallons (0 to stop): 2
                That is 7.52 litres
                How many gallons (0 to stop): 1.1
                That is 4.14 litres
                How many gallons (0 to stop): 0
