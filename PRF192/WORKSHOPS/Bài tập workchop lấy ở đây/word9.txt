        9.  Write a function

                int trim(char str1[])

            that removes  all  leading  and  trailing  spaces  from  the
            null-terminated string in "str1" and returns the new  length
            of the string.

            Hint: Move through "str1" looking for the  first  non-blank.
            Once you find it, move it  to  position  0,  move  the  next
            character to position 1, and so on until the null  byte  has
            been moved back. Then, keep moving the null byte back  until
            the character before it is non-blank. The final position  of
            the null byte is the new length.
