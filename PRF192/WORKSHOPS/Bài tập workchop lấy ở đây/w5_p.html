               In this workshop, you are to design a function that returns

               <p class=section>Fraction Simplifier</p>
               <p>
               Your company has been asked to write a fraction calculator.&nbsp;
               Your group has been assigned the task of simplifying fractions.
               </p>
               <p>
               Design and code a program that simplifies fractions.&nbsp; Your
               program prompts for and accepts the numerator and denominator of
               a fraction and displays the fraction in simplified form.&nbsp;
               To calculate the simplified numerator and denominator, design the
               <span class=code>simplify</span> function
               described below.&nbsp;</p>
               <p>
               The output from your program looks something like
               <table width="45%">

               Design and code a function named <span class=code>simplify</span> that simplifies
               the numerator and denominator of a fraction.&nbsp;
               The function receives the addresses of two <span class=code>int</span> variables
               holding the numerator and denominator respectively and
               returns to those addresses the simplified numerator and
               denominator values, if simplification was possible.&nbsp;
               The function does not return any value itself.&nbsp;
               The header of your function looks something like:
               <table width="45%">
               <tr>
               <td>
               <br />

               <p class=section>Fireworks</p>
               <p>
               You have been asked to design a set of simultaneous fireworks for your
               next National holiday.&nbsp; In the design, you need to ensure that
               each firework reaches a specified height.&nbsp;</p>
               <p>
               You know that the height (in m) of a projectile is given by
               the formula
               <pre class=defin>
 h = - g * t<sup>2</sup> / 2 + b * t</pre>
               where <span class=code>t</span> is the time from launch, <span class=code>g</span> is
               the acceleration due to gravity (9.8 m/sec<sup>2</sup>) and
               <span class=code>b</span> is the initial vertical velocity component
               (in m/sec).&nbsp;
               <p>
               Design and code a program that calculates the time at which a
               projectile will reach a certain height.&nbsp; Your program prompts
               for and accepts the initial vertical velocity component and the desired height.&nbsp;
               Your program handles cases where the desired height
               is the maximum height reached and cases where the desired height is
               never reached.&nbsp;
               Your program stops asking for input and terminates if the user
               enters 0 for the initial vertical velocity.&nbsp;
               To determine the solution of the above equation, design and code the
               <span class=code>roots</span> function described
               below.&nbsp;
               </p>
               <p>
               Your output might look something like:
               <table width="45%">
               <tr>
               <td>
               <br />
               <pre class=result>

 =========
 Initial vertical velocity (m/sec) (0 to quit) : 20
 Desired Height (m):                             10

 Your firework will reach the desired height at times:
   0.58 sec
   3.50 sec

 Initial vertical velocity (m/sec) (0 to quit) : 20
 Desired Height (m):                             20.408163265306122&nbsp;

 Your firework will reach the desired height at time:
   2.04 sec

 Initial vertical velocity (m/sec) (0 to quit) : 20
 Desired Height (m):                             21

 Your firework will never reach 21.00 m

 Initial vertical velocity (m/sec) (0 to quit) : 0

               Design and code a C function
               named <span class=code>roots</span> that calculates the roots
               of a quadratic equation.&nbsp; Your function
               receives three doubles that hold the coefficients of the
               quadratic equation and returns through two other double parameters
               the real roots of the equation.&nbsp;
               The function returns the number of real roots found
               as the return value of the function itself.&nbsp;
               The header for your function looks something like
               <table width="45%">
               <tr>

               <br />
               <pre>
 int roots(double a, double b, double c, double *r1, double *r2)&nbsp;</pre><br /></td></tr></table>
               Consider the quadratic equation:
               <pre class=defin>
 f(x) = a * x<sup>2</sup> + b * x + c
               </pre>
               where <span class=code>a</span>, <span class=code>b</span> and
               <span class=code>tc</span> are constant coefficients.&nbsp; This equation
               may have up to 2 real roots.&nbsp; The roots are the
               values of <span class=code>x</span> for which
               <pre class=defin>
 a * x<sup>2</sup> + b * x + c = 0
               </pre>
               The roots are given by the equations
               <pre class=defin>
 x<sub>1</sub> = ( - b + sqrt( D ) ) / ( 2 * a )
 x<sub>2</sub> = ( - b - sqrt( D ) ) / ( 2 * a )</pre>
               where D is the discriminant
               <pre class=defin>
 D = b<sup>2</sup> - 4 * a * c</pre>
               If <span class=code>D</span> is positive-valued, there are 2 real roots.&nbsp;
               If <span class=code>D</span> is
               zero-valued, there is one real root.&nbsp;
               If <span class=code>D</span> is
               negative-valued, there are no real roots.
               <p>
               If there is one real root, set <span class=code>x<sub>1</sub></span> to its value and leave <span class=code>x<sub>2</sub></span> unchanged.&nbsp;
               If there are no real roots, leave <span class=code>x<sub>1</sub></span> and <span class=code>x<sub>2</sub></span> unchanged.&nbsp;
