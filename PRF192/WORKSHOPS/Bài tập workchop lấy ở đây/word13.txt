        13. Write a function

                void firstword(char word[], char sentence[])

            that copies the first word  of  the  null-terminated  string
            "sentence" into the null-terminated string "word". If  there
            are no words in "sentence"  (because  it  is  empty  or  all
            blanks) then "word" should be set to be empty. Assume that a
            word is simply a series of non-blank  characters,  separated
            from other words by blanks. Thus, for example,
                firstword(x, "This is a sentence");

            would copy "This" into the array x, and
                firstword(x, " and$%^# so is this");

            would copy "and$%^#" into x.

               (Hint: find the position of  the  first  non-blank,  then
               copy things over until you hit a blank or the end of  the
               string).
