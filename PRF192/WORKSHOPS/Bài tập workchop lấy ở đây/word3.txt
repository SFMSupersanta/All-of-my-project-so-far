        3.  Write a C program that asks  the  user,  a  wholesale  sales
            person, to enter the total amount of a sale to a client. The
            program rejects (with  an  appropriate  error  message)  any
            amount less than zero, forcing  the  user  to  re-enter  the
            amount. Once an  allowable  amount  has  been  entered,  the
            program displays the client's  volume  discount,  the  total
            after the discount, and the sales person's commission, based
            on the following information:
                Discount - 0% on the total, if the total is less
                            than $1000.
                         - 5% of the total if the total is between
                            $1000 and $20,000.
                         - 10% of the total if the total is over
                            $20,000.
                Commission - based on the total less the discount
                           - 5% of the first $10,000
                           - 10% on everything over $10,000

            As an example, a sale of $15,000 would receive a discount of
            $750, making the net sale $14,250. The commission  would  be
            $925 (which is 500 + 425).
