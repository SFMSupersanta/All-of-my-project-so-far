        11. Write a C program that asks the user to enter  three  names,
            up to 30 characters each, and then  displays  the  names  in
            alphabetical order. (Note that  the  order  should  be  case
            sensitive, with upper case letters first  as  in  the  ASCII
            table, so that Fred is after FRED, but before fred, and  aaa
            is after ZZZ).
