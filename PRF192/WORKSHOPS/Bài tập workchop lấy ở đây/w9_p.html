               <p class=section>Introduction</p>
               <p>
               Statistics helps summarize data in interesting and meaningful ways.&nbsp;
               The data may consist of values from a variety of sources.&nbsp;
               Statistics identifies what is common and the degree of
               variation about what is common.&nbsp; In cases where a
               data set has several aspects, statistics
               determines the extent to which one aspect of the set is
               related to another aspect of the set.&nbsp;
               </p>
               <p>
               For example, consider a video store with a
               large selection of rental videos at various
               prices.&nbsp; We determine the average
               price of a video in the store, the degree of
               price variation about this average and then
               infer something about the clientele who rent
               videos from that store.&nbsp; </p>
               <p>
               If we suspect that the price of
               each video was determined by the date of its
               original release, we use statistics
               to determine numerically if there is indeed any
               correlation between the rental price and the
               original release date.&nbsp; Moreover, we
               determine the degree of any such correlation.&nbsp;
               </p>
               <br />

               <p class=section>Statistics Calculator</p>
               <p>
               Design and code a program that calculates statistical
               measures for a set of data values stored in a file.&nbsp;
               The program prompts for and accepts the name of the data file
               and reads each record in the file, calculating the mean and
               the standard deviation of the data values.&nbsp;
               The data file contains one floating point value per
               record.&nbsp; Each record is delimited by a newline.</p>
               <p>
               For a sample containing n values, the key statistical indicators include
               <ul>
               <li>mean
               <pre class=defin>
 m = ( a<sub>1</sub> + a<sub>2</sub> + a<sub>3</sub> + ... + a<sub>n</sub> ) / n
               </pre>
               </li>
               <li>sum of the squares of the values
               <pre class=defin>
 s = a<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup> + a<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup> + a<sub>3</sub><sup>2</sup> + ... + a<sub>n</sub><sup>2</sup>
               </pre>
               </li>
               <li>standard deviation (d)
               <pre class=defin>
 d<sup>2</sup> = ( s / n ) - m<sup>2</sup></pre>

               <p class=section>Regression Analysis Calculator</p>
               <p>
               Design and code a program that prompts for and accepts the name
               of a data file and then reads data value pairs from the file,
               while performing a linear regression
               analysis on the set of data value pairs.&nbsp;
               </p>
               <p>
               The data file contains two values per record, with
               the two fields delimited by whitespace and each
               record delimited by a newline.</p>
               <p>
               Linear regression analysis models the statistical relationship
               between two sets of data values.&nbsp;
               Typically, we use the method of least squares
               to determine the line that best fits the
               scatter of data points on an x-y graph.&nbsp;
               The formulas for the line are:
               <ul>
               <li>slope (t)
               <pre class=defin>
 t = [ (x<sub>1</sub> - m<sub>x</sub>)(y<sub>1</sub> - m<sub>y</sub>) + (x<sub>2</sub> - m<sub>x</sub>)(y<sub>2</sub> - m<sub>y</sub>) +
      ... + (x<sub>n</sub> - m<sub>x</sub>)(y<sub>n</sub> - m<sub>y</sub>)] /
    [ (x<sub>1</sub> - m<sub>x</sub>)<sup>2</sup> + (x<sub>2</sub> - m<sub>x</sub>)<sup>2</sup> + ... + (x<sub>n</sub> - m<sub>x</sub>)<sup>2</sup>]
               </pre>
               </li>
               <li>y-intercept (b)
               <pre class=defin>
 b = m<sub>y</sub> - t m<sub>x</sub></pre>
               </li>
               </ul>
               where m denotes the mean, which is given by
               <pre class=defin>
 m<sub>x</sub> = ( x<sub>1</sub> + x<sub>2</sub> + x<sub>3</sub> + ... + x<sub>n</sub> ) / n
 m<sub>y</sub> = ( y<sub>1</sub> + y<sub>2</sub> + y<sub>3</sub> + ... + y<sub>n</sub> ) / n
               </pre>
               The statistical measure that indicates how well our best fit line models the
               relationship between the variables is called the
               correlation coefficient (Pearson or Product-Moment Correlation Coefficient)
               and is given by the formula
               <pre class=defin>
 r = { [ (x<sub>1</sub>y<sub>1</sub>) + (x<sub>2</sub>y<sub>2</sub>) + ... + (x<sub>n</sub>y<sub>n</sub>) ] / n - m<sub>x</sub> m<sub>y</sub>} / [ d<sub>x</sub> d<sub>y</sub> ]</pre>
               where d denotes the standard deviation, which is given by
               <pre class=defin>
 (d<sub>x</sub>)<sup>2</sup> = ( s<sub>x</sub> / n ) - m<sub>x</sub><sup>2</sup>
 (d<sub>y</sub>)<sup>2</sup> = ( s<sub>y</sub> / n ) - m<sub>y</sub><sup>2</sup>
               </pre>
               where s denotes the sum of the squares, which is
               given by
               <pre class=defin>
 s<sub>x</sub> = x<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup> + x<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup> + x<sub>3</sub><sup>2</sup> + ... + x<sub>n</sub><sup>2</sup>
 s<sub>y</sub> = y<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup> + y<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup> + y<sub>3</sub><sup>2</sup> + ... + y<sub>n</sub><sup>2</sup>
               </pre>
