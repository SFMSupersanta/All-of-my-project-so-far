        5.  Write a function
                void histogram(int array[], int count)
            which is passed an  array  of  numbers  and  the  number  of
            elements in the array, and then displays a histogram of that
            array using asterisks. For example,  if  an  array  named  x
            contained the six values  {  5,  1,  2,  4,  3,  4  },  then
            histogram(x, 6) would output:
                    *****
                    *
                    **
                    ****
                    ***
                    ****
            (If a value is 0 or less, output  an  empty  line  for  that
            value)
