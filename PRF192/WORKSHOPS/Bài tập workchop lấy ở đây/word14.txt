        14. Suppose a file, named inventory.dat, stores inventory  data.
            Each line of the file has an item name, quantity on hand and
            unit price, separated by semi-colons. A  sample  file  might
            be:
                Hammer;10;9.99
                Phillips Head Screwdriver;5;7.99
                Saw;2;9.95

            Write a program that displays the total  value  of  all  the
            inventory (which is the sum of quantity times price for  all
            records of the file).  For  example,  with  the  data  shown
            above, the program outputs:
                Total inventory value is $159.75

            You may assume the maximum description  will  be  no  longer
            than 35 characters. If the file cannot be read, your program
            should output a meaningful error message.
