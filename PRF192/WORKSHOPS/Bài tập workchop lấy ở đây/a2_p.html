               <p>
               As your second assignment this semester, you are to upgrade
               your Payroll Deductions Program to validate the user input.&nbsp;
               </p>
               <br />

               <p class="section">Learning Outcomes</p>
               <p>
               Upon successful completion of this assignment, you
               will have demonstrated the ability to use
               sequence, selection and iteration constructs.
               </p>
               <br />

               <p class="section">Specifications</p>
               <p>
               You may assume that the user will only enter numbers, whitespace, and
               possibly a decimal point, but no other characters.&nbsp;
               </p>
               <p>
               If the user provides input to your program that is outside
               acceptable or reasonable bounds, your program rejects that
               input and requests alternate input.&nbsp; Examples of unacceptable or
               unreasonable input include:
               <ul>
               <li>input is negative in value</li>
               <li>RRSP contribution exceeds the income</li>
               <li>Union dues exceed the income less the RRSP contribution</li>
               <li>a decimal point appears in integer input</li>
               <li>more than one decimal point appears in floating-point input</li>
               </ul>
