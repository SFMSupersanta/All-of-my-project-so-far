        16. Assume a file, named "times.dat", contains records that look
            like:

                12:56a 15
                1:20p 20
                3:01a 5
                11:12a 55

            where each line contains a time (hour, followed by a  colon,
            followed by a minute, followed by 'a' for AM or 'p' for PM),
            and a number of minutes, separated by a space. The number of
            minutes will never be negative.

            Write a program that, for each line in  the  file,  displays
            the new time that you get by adding the supplied  number  of
            minutes to the supplied time. For example, using the  sample
            data shown above, the output of the program would be:

                1:11a 1:40p 3:06a 12:07p

            Hints:
                Read question 6 first.

                Write a loop to read through the file,  one  line  at  a
                time. For each line from the file, write  a  loop  which
                calls, over and over again, the  function  described  in
                question 6, to add the required number of minutes.

                Regardless of whether or not your answer to  question  6
                is correct, your answer may  assume  that  the  function
                described in 6 has been written  by  someone  and  works
                according to its specifications.
