               As your first assignment this semester, you are to write a C
               program that calculates the amounts that an Ontario employer
               should deduct from an employee's salary and remit to the Canada
               Customs and Revenue Agency.&nbsp;

               Upon successful completion of this assignment, you
               will have demonstrated the ability to use
               sequence and selection constructs.

               <p class="section">Introduction</p>
               <p>
               The Canada Customs and Revenue Agency (CCRA) lists the

               target="_top"><u>formulas</u></a> for
               designing payroll deduction programs along with examples of
               how to apply those formulas (if you want to match these with the assignment,
               make sure you view the PDF file from January 2005).&nbsp;
               The CCRA payroll deductions include
               <ul>
               <li>income tax withholdings,</li>
               <li>Canada Pension Plan (CPP) contributions and</li>
               <li>Employment Insurance (EI) premiums.&nbsp;</li>
               </ul>
               To calculate these deductions, the employer uses
               the employee's gross salary, the number of pay periods in
               the calendar year, the amounts shown on the employee's federal
               and provincial personal tax credit returns and the year-to-date
               CCP contributions and EI premiums.
               <p>
               The income tax deduction consists of separate federal and
               provincial components, each of which is based upon an
               estimate of the employee's annual taxable income.&nbsp; The employer
               estimates this annual income by subtracting any eligible deductions
               such as RRSP contributions and union dues from the gross income for
               the pay period,
               by multiplying this net income by the number of pay
               periods in the year and finally by subtracting any authourized
               annual deductions.&nbsp;
               <p>
               The employer calculates the federal and provincial taxes
               using rates and overcharge constants that increase
               with the amount of taxable income itself.&nbsp; The higher
               the income, the higher the rate and the overcharge constant.&nbsp;
               This is known as a progressive tax regime.&nbsp;
               </p>
               <p>
               The figures noted below are valid for 2005.&nbsp; These figures are indexed
               from year to year.&nbsp;
               That is, they are subject to annual adjustment
               in accord with changes in the consumer price index.
               </p>
               <p class="ssection">Federal</p>
               <p>
               For 2005, the federal government identifies four tax brackets:
               <ul>
               <li>taxable income of $35,595 or less attracts tax at 16%
               <li>taxable income of more than $35,595 and not more than $71,190
               attracts tax at 22% less $2,136;
               <li>taxable income of more than $71,190 and not more than $115,739
               attracts tax at 26% less $4,983; and
               <li>taxable income of more than $115,739 attracts tax at 29% less
               $8,455.
               </ul>
               <p>
               The employer calculates the federal tax using the appropriate bracket
               values.&nbsp;
               The employer then calculates the non-refundable personal tax credits, the CPP
               credits, the EI credits and any labour-sponsored share purchase credit.&nbsp;
               The non-refundable personal credits are the federal credits claimed
               by the employee multiplied by the lowest federal tax rate.&nbsp; The
               CPP and EI credits are the pay period CPP and EI amounts multiplied
               by the lowest federal tax rate.&nbsp; However, the pay period amounts when
               multiplied by the number of pay periods do not exceed the CPP and
               EI annual maximums.
               </p>
               <p>
               The employer deducts CPP contributions at 4.95% of
               the gross income for the pay period less the
               pro-rated annual exemption of $3,500.&nbsp;
               For 2005, the upper limit on annual CPP contributions is $1,861.20.
               </p>
               <p>
               The employer deducts EI premiums at 1.95% of
               the gross income for the pay period.&nbsp;
               For 2005, the upper limit on EI premiums is $760.50.
               </p>
               <p>
               The federal government allows an annual credit
               for labour-sponsored share purchases.&nbsp; This credit
               is the lesser of
               <ul>
               <li>$750 and
               <li>15% of the amount deducted or withheld during the year for
               acquisition by the employee of approved labour-sponsored shares
               </ul>
               The employer obtains the basic federal tax by subtracting from the
               federal tax, the non-refundable personal tax credits, the CPP credits
               and the EI credits.&nbsp; The employer then obtains the annual federal
               tax deduction by subtracting from the basic federal tax the annual credit
               for labour-sponsored share purchases.&nbsp;
               <p>
               The federal tax deduction is this annual federal
               tax deduction divided by the number of pay periods.
               </p>

               </p>
               <p class="ssection">Provincial</p>
               <p>
               For 2005, the Ontario government identifies three tax brackets:
               <ul>
               <li>taxable income of $34,010 or less attracts tax at 6.05%
               <li>taxable income more than $34,010 and not more than $68,020
               attracts tax at 9.15% less $1,054;
               <li>taxable income more than $68,020 attracts tax at
               11.16% less $2,422.
               </ul>
               <p>
               The employer calculates the provincial tax using the appropriate
               bracket formula.&nbsp; The employer then calculates the non-refundable
               personal tax credits, the CPP credits, the EI credits, any surtaxes,
               any tax reduction, any health premium and any labour-sponsored share
               purchase credit.&nbsp; The non-refundable personal tax credits
               are the provincial credits claimed by the employee multiplied by
               the lowest provincial tax rate.&nbsp; The CPP and EI credits are
               the pay period CPP and EI amounts multiplied by the lowest provincial
               tax rate.&nbsp; However, the pay period amount when multiplied by the
               number of pay period do not exceed the CPP and EI annual maximums.
               </p>
               <p>
               The basic provincial tax is the provincial tax less the non-refundable
               tax credits, the CPP credits and the EI credits.
               </p>
               <p>
               The Ontario government levies two surtaxes on the
               basic provincial tax.&nbsp;  The surtax formulas for 2005 are
               <ul>
               <li>20% of (basic Ontario Tax less $3,929) plus
               <li>36% of (basic Ontario Tax less $4,957)
               </ul>
               The Ontario government allows a tax reduction.&nbsp; The
               tax reduction is the lesser of
               <ul>
               <li>the basic provincial tax plus the surtax and
               <li>2 times ($190 + $350 times the number of dependants under the age of 18)
               less the sum of the basic provincial tax and the surtax (but not less than zero)
               </ul>
               The Ontario government also levies an Ontario Health
               Premium on the annual taxable income:&nbsp;
               <ul>
               <li>taxable income of $20,000 or less attracts a premium of $0;</li>
               <li>taxable income of more than $20,000 and not more than $36,000
               attracts a premium equal to the lesser of $300 and 6% of taxable
               income greater than $20,000;</li>
               <li>taxable income of more than $36,000 and not more than $48,000
               attracts a premium equal to the lesser of $450 and $300 plus 6% of taxable
               income greater than $36,000;</li>
               <li>taxable income of more than $48,000 and not more than $72,000
               attracts a premium equal to the lesser of $600 and $450 plus 25% of taxable
               income greater than $48,000;</li>
               <li>taxable income of more than $72,000 and not more than $200,000
               attracts a premium equal to the lesser of $750 and $600 plus 25% of taxable
               income greater than $72,000;</li>
               <li>taxable income of more than $200,000
               attracts a premium equal to the lesser of $900 and $750 plus 25% of taxable
               income greater than $200,000;</li>
               </ul>
               Moreover, the Ontario government allows an annual credit
               for labour-sponsored share purchases.&nbsp; This credit
               is the lesser of
               <ul>
               <li>$750 and
               <li>15% of the amount deducted or withheld during the year for
               acquisition by the employee of approved labour-sponsored share purchases
               </ul>
               The employer obtains the annual provincial tax deduction by subtracting
               from the sum of the basic provincial tax, the surtax and the health premium,
               the tax reduction and the credit for labour-sponsored share purchases.&nbsp;
               <p>
               The provincial tax deduction is the annual provincial tax deduction divided
               by the number of pay periods.

               By default, the <span class="code">%lf</span> printf conversion specification displays six
               (6) decimal places without leading spaces.&nbsp;  To limit the number
               of decimal places to two (2), use <span class="code">%.2lf</span> instead of
               <span class="code">%lf</span>. To
               display the number right-justified in a field of 10 columns,
               use <span class="code">%10.2lf</span>.&nbsp; This will align
               the decimal points on your output.&nbsp;

               To define 'constants' that may change from year to year, use
               the preprocessor directive

 #define SYMBOLIC_NAME VALUE</pre>
               Place this directive before your main program and after your

               program code and set the VALUE in the preprocessor
               statement.&nbsp; For example, for 2005
