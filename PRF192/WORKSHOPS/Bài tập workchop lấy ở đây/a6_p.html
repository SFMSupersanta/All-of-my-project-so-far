               <p>
               As your sixth and final assignment this semester, you are to amend your
               bookkeeping program to store
               <ul>
               <li>the accounts in a sequential text file named <span class=code>accounts.dat</span></li>
               <li>the transactions in a sequential text file named <span class=code>transactions.dat</span></li>
               </ul>
               <p>
               If these file(s) exist with account and/or transaction information, then that information will be
               read and used by your program to populate the relevant arrays before the user is asked for input
               </p>
               <br />

               <p class="section">Learning Outcome</p>
               <p>
               Upon successful completion of this assignment, you
               will have demonstrated the ability to use
               sequential text files.
               </p>
               <br />

               <p class="section">Specifications</p>
               <p>
               This version of your bookkeeping program stores all account
               information in a file named <span class=code>accounts.dat</span>&nbsp;
               The accounts.dat file contains one transaction per record
               and each record should contain two fields delimited by the colon
               character ':'.&nbsp; The two fields are:
               <ul>
               <li>account number</li>
               <li>account title</li>
               </ul>
               For example, a few records might look like:
               <table width="45%">
               <tr>
               <td>
               <br />
               <pre>
 1000:Cash
 3000:Common Shares Outstanding
 1400:Office Equipment
 2000:Credit Card Payable
 2100:Long Term Debt</pre><br /></td></tr></table>
               <p>
               Your program limits the number of accounts to 100.</p>
               <p>
               Also, this version of your bookkeeping program stores all transaction
               information in a file named <span class=code>transactions.dat</span>&nbsp;
               The transaction file contains one transaction per record
               and each record should contain four fields delimited by the colon
               character ':'.&nbsp; The four fields are:
               <ul>
               <li>account number</li>
               <li>transaction title</li>
               <li>transaction type</li>
               <li>transaction amount</li>
               </ul>
               For example, a few records might look like:
               <table width="45%">
               <tr>
               <td>
               <br />
               <pre>
 1000:Common Shares Issued:d:4000.00
 3000:Investor #2314:c:4000.00
 1400:Office Equipment:d:2100.99
 2000:Future Shop:c:2100.99
 2100:Royal Bank:c:3500.00
 1000:Long Term Loan:d:3500.00</pre><br /></td></tr></table>
               <p>
               Your program limits the number of transactions to 20.</p>
               <p>
               Whenever the user enters a new transaction, your program stores
               the transaction information at the end of the <span class=code>transactions.dat</span> file.&nbsp;
               If the transaction introduces a new account, your program stores
               the account information at the end of the <span class=code>accounts.dat</span>file.
               </p>
               <p>
               Here is a sample run showing the new error messages as well as general journals, balance sheets, income statements,
               and the accounts.dat and transactions.dat file. There should be a similar error message for an unwriteable
               accounts.dat file as is shown for the unwriteable transactions.dat file:
               <a href="a6Sample.html" tppabs="http://cs.senecac.on.ca/~btp100/pages/assignments/a6Sample.html">Sample run</a>
