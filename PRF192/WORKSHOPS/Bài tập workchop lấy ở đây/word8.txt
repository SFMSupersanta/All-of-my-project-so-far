        8.  Write a function

                int deblank(char str1[])

            that removes all spaces from the null-terminated  string  in
            "str1" and returns the number of spaces removed.

            Hint: Move through "str1" looking for spaces. Every time you
            find one, copy everything  on  the  right  of  it  over  one
            character to the left.
