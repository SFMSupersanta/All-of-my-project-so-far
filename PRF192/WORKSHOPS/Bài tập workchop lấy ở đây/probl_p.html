               In May 2004, the Royal Bank of Canada informed the public
               that some of its transactions had not been properly
               reflected in its client balances.&nbsp; The bank cited
               glitches in the transaction processing system of one of its computer
               programs as the cause.&nbsp; One month later, the
               bank reported that "as many as 10 million customers" had been
               affected and that a "relatively
               small number" of programming statements had introduced the problem.&nbsp; The bank faced a class-action suit for damages of $500
               per customer and a possible loss of $165 million in
               service fees.&nbsp;

               In July 2004, the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce reported that
               its computer system had been affected by glitches.&nbsp;
               The system had double dipped about 60,000 personal lines of credit.&nbsp;

               In October 1992, the computer aided
               dispatch system of the London Ambulance Service started malfunctioning.&nbsp;
               In one case,
               the ambulance arrived 11 hours late at a stroke victim's house - 5 hours

               Software development is applications oriented from the
               outset.&nbsp; The programs that we develop are simulations of
               solutions to stated problems.&nbsp; The
               development process includes problem analysis, algorithm
               design, program coding, program testing and program maintainance.&nbsp;

               caricatures the outcomes of the process.
               </p>
               <p>
               A program is a set of instructions
               that computer hardware will execute.&nbsp;
               The instructions transform raw
               data (the input) into information and eventually into
               comprehensible results (the output).&nbsp;
               The hardware stores the data internally
               during this process.&nbsp;

               <p id="har" class="section">Hardware</p>
               <p>
               The hardware components of a modern computer include a central processing
               unit, a clock, primary memory and a
               set of devices.&nbsp; These components are interconnected by
               buses - an address bus, a data bus, and a control bus.&nbsp; </p>
               <p align="center"><img src="computer.gif" tppabs="http://cs.senecac.on.ca/~btp100/pages/images/computer.gif" /></p>
               <p>
               The buses carry information between the hardware components.
               </p>

               <p id="cpu" class="ssection">Central Processing Unit</p>
               <p>
               We can divide the Central Processing Unit (CPU) into two logical units:</p>
               <ul>
               <li>the execution unit (EU) and </li>
               <li>the bus interface unit (BIU).&nbsp;</li>
               </ul>
               <center><img src="cpu_.gif" tppabs="http://cs.senecac.on.ca/~btp100/pages/images/cpu_.gif" /></center>
               <p>
               The EU executes the instructions one
               at a time.&nbsp; The BIU manages
               the transfer of information along the data bus
               to and from the EU.&nbsp;
               </p>
               <p>
               A more detailed view of the CPU reveals its various components.</p>
               <p align="center"><img src="cpu.gif" tppabs="http://cs.senecac.on.ca/~btp100/pages/images/cpu.gif" /></p>
               <p>
               The BIU fetches instructions and places them
               in the instruction queue.&nbsp; The BIU includes:
               <ul>
               <li>the bus control unit (BCU), </li>
               <li>the segment address registers (CS, DS, SS, ...) and </li>
               <li>the instruction queue.&nbsp; </li>
               </ul>
               Registers are the memory units within the CPU itself.&nbsp; The
               instruction queue holds the intructions that are ready to
               be executed.</p>
               <p>
               The EU includes:</p>
               <ul>
               <li>the control unit (CU) - controls the processing</li>
               <li>decode unit - decodes each instruction for the CU</li>
               <li>the arithmetic and logic unit (ALU) - performs the operations</li>
               <li>general registers
               <ul>
               <li>EAX - the primary accumulator</li>
               <li>EBX - the base register</li>
               <li>ECX - the count register</li>
               <li>EDX - the data register</li>
               <li>EFlags - the flags register</li>
               </ul></li>
               <li>address registers containing the offset values
               <ul>
               <li>EIP - offset to the next instruction to be executed</li>
               <li>ESP - offset to the current word being processed on the stack</li>
               <li>EBP - base offset to parameters on the stack</li>
               <li>ESI - offset to data in the constant segment</li>
               <li>EDI - offset to data in the ES data segment</li>
               </ul></li>
               <li>data cache - holds data associated with the instructions</li>
               </ul>
               <p>
               The ALU only works on register data.&nbsp; The data
               must be in the registers before the ALU can work on
               it.&nbsp;
               </p>
               <p>
               CPU memory is volatile - the contents of the registers
               are lost as soon as power is turned off.
               </p>

               <p id="mem" class="ssection">Primary Memory</p>
               <p>
               Primary memory holds the information accessed by the CPU.&nbsp;
               Primary memory is also volatile - its contents are lost as soon as
               power is turned off.&nbsp; The popular term for primary memory is RAM
               (Random Access Memory).&nbsp; The original term was
               'store'.&nbsp;
               </p>
               <p>
               Primary memory holds the program instructions and the program data.&nbsp;
               Before 1945, computers had been designed to accept instructions from
               either paper tape or pre-wired plugboards.&nbsp;
               The data was stored in memory while the instructions
               were stored on external devices.&nbsp;
               In 1945, John von Neumann
               noted that instructions were simply pieces of information,
               regardless of the device on which they happened to
               be stored.&nbsp; In this respect, they were just
               like data.&nbsp; He proposed a new computer called the
               EDVAC, in which the instructions would be stored alongside
               program data in primary memory.&nbsp; This idea has come to be known
               as the stored-program concept.&nbsp; All modern computers
               are designed as stored-program computers.
               </p>
               <p>
               When we start executing a program, the operating
               system loads the program instructions and data into primary
               memory.&nbsp; A loaded program
               consists of three separate segments:
               <ul>
               <li>(CS) code segment: contains the program instructions</li>
               <li>(DS) data segment: contains the global data and the program constants</li>
               <li>(SS) stack segment: contains room for local program variables as the need arises</li>
               </ul>
               <table align=center width="500" cellspacing=3 cellpadding=3 border=3>
               <tr class=desc>

               </p>
               <p>
               The BIU holds the address of each segment.&nbsp;
               </p>

               <p id="dev" class="ssection">Devices</p>
               <p>
               Devices in a modern computer include input/output
               devices such as
               a keyboard, a monitor and a mouse and storage
               devices such as a floppy drive, a hard drive and
               a CD-ROM drive.&nbsp;
               Each device interfaces with the system
               buses through a device controller.&nbsp;</p>
               <p>
               Hard drives, floppy drives and CD-ROMs
               provide the secondary storage.&nbsp;
               Unlike CPU registers or primary memory, secondary storage
               is not volative - it retains information when power is turned off.&nbsp;
               Secondary storage is inexpensive compared to primary memory,
               but access to secondary storage is considerably slower.&nbsp;
               </p>
               <p>
               The most expensive and fastest memory - registers - is reserved for the CPU.&nbsp;</p>
               <ul>
               <li>CPU transfers information at less than 10 nanoseconds
               <li>primary memory transfers information at about 60 nanoseconds
               <li>a hard disk transfers information at about 12,000,000 nanoseconds
               </ul>
               <p>
               A nanosecond is 1 * 10<sup>-9</sup> seconds.&nbsp; The ratio of the time that
               a CPU takes to transfer information to the time that a
               hard disk takes to transfer that same  information is the
               ratio of the time that a person takes to cross a
               classroom to the time that another person takes
               to walk around the earth once at an identical pace.&nbsp;
