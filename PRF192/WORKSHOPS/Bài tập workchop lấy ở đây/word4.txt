        4.  Write a C program that asks the user  to  enter  a  monetary
            amount, and then gives the user the following choice:
                1. Tax Exempt
                2. PST only (8%)
                3. GST only (7%)
                4. Both PST and GST
            If the user enters any number other than 1-4, he or  she  is
            given an error message and is forced to choose again,  until
            a proper choice is made.

            The program displays the original amount, the  tax  on  that
            amount (which depends on the  choice  they  made),  and  the
            total including tax.
