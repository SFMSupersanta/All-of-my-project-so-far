////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Design and code a program that calculates the number of 
permutations or combinations of a set of items.  Your program 
prompts for and accepts the total number of items, the number 
of items in each group and whether the order of the items in a 

group matters. 

Design your program according to structured design principles 
and write a function that can readily be used in both calculations, 
as well as in other applications.  Do not use any library 
functions apart from <stdio.h> functions. 

Preface your function header with a comprehensive description 
of the function purpose, the function parameters and the function 
return value.

With permutations, the order of items within each group matters.  
A group with the same items as another group but arranged in a 
different order is distinct from the other group.  With 
combinations, the order of the items within each group does not 
matter.  A group with the same items as another group but arranged 
in a different order is the same as the other group.

Consider a set of n items.  The number of permutations of the 
three digits 0,1 and 2 in two-digit groups is 6:

 01 02 12 20 21 10

The general formula for a permutation of n items in groups of 
k items is given by

 nPk = n! / ( n - k )!
where ! denotes factorial.  The formula for the factorial of 
n is given by
 n! = n * ( n - 1 ) * ( n - 2 ) * ... * 2 * 1
The number of combinations of the three digits 0,1 and 2 in 
two-digit groups is 3:

 01 02 12

The general formula for a combination of n items in groups of k 
items is given by

 nCk = n! / ( k! * ( n - k )! )
where ! denotes factorial. 
The output from your program should look something like: 

 Probability Calculator
 ======================
 Quantity from which to select:   49
 Quantity to be selected:         6
 Does order matter (y or n) ? :   n

 Number of possible outcomes is 13983816
